helloWhile you are navigating through the website, you will notice that most names are underlined. If you click on one of these names, a drop down menu wil appear underneath of their name, with a list of visualizations that are connected to that person. To select a visualization, simply click on the name within the menu. This functionality carries on even within visualizations, to make navigations between visualizations easier. Our hope is that while exploring the site, you will begin to create your own narrative about the Cope and Evans family, as you begin to see just how intertwined each actor is to the larger story.
