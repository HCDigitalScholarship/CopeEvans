                <h1>About the Project</h1> 
                <p>What is this project: The focus of our project are the changing networks and relationships during the Industrial Age for Quakers, as seen through the exchange of letters between the Cope Evans family, a prominent Philadelphia-area Quaker family, during 1790 to 1910.</p> 
                <p>How did networks change for Quakers from 1790 to 1910: They extended, accelerated, intensified, and diversified. But as stated before, we will narrow our view to intensifying networks. In claiming that the intensity of connections increased we suggest that connections became more interconnected and thicker, meaning that connections were more organized and had a greater influence on this group.
</p> 
                <p>Networks and relationships changed because of a demand specific to the time and group to engage with the outside world (relationship of Quakers to the Outside world) as seen through political, economic, and social motives and demonstrated in travel the changing times in areas of changing technology and a changing Philadelphia landscapes (relationship of Quakers to the time)</p> 
                <p>As a result,changing networks and relationships influenced:</p> 
                <p>Travel, Education, Fashion, Philanthropy</p> <!-- to add scrolling effects to links linking to same page section, add .link-scroll class --> <!-- content which will be shown in the popup/modal when clicking on the above link

From there, we move into narratives of the later generations highlighted by the explorations and letters of Clementine Cope and the public works of Francis Reeve Cope during the Reconstruction.

There are many questions this project has produced and will produce, and it was a relentless struggle to restrain ourselves. This project ought to serve as an invitation into more possibilities, questions, and scholarly research.  A possible question and caveat of this project is surrounded around how the Cope Evans family and their values or practices may differ from Quakers of their time due to their affluence.</p>

Beginning in circa 1790 to span the Second Industrial Age, Quakerism transformed from a theologically bordered religion and a cloistered community with few far reaching movements to incorporate parts of an outside world that Quakers previously fought against. The resulting changes in relationships, values, and networks would eventually diffuse into, although with much resistance, many aspects of the Quaker lifestyle like education, travel, fashion, and philanthropy.

              <p>Our argument, analysis, and re-narration of this Quaker history through the Cope-Evans family and Quakers as a whole, contribute insight into the mechanisms and products of this reaction by a specific group to this specific time.</p><a href="#carousel"></a>

Upon further research and placing the documents in a large historical of the time period and of Quakers during that time period, we were able to narrow our view to education and travel.</p> <!-- to make a popup/modal link add an onClick function call to the function:

                <h1>Conclusion</h1> 
                <p>While this research is inconclusive and this argument incomplete, the theories suggested and analyses contributed offer a new interpretation of how the Industrial Age changed Quakerism. To summarize, the technological innovations, the changing landscapes of Philadelphia, and the new demand for engagement with the world outside Quakers communities that were unique to the Industrial Age incited the extension and intensification of networks pertaining to travel and communication, and the diversification of networks in the form of philanthropy. These changes directly affected how the Quaker lifestyle of select Quakers, notably the members of the Cope Evans family, was practiced in the form of travel, education, as well as other unexamined areas such as fashion, architecture, and the role of women. We invite research into the Cope Evans collection and into the larger themes that we were unable to explore.

                <p><img data-img-src="{{STATIC_URL}}images/other_images/transp-image4.png" class="lazy rounded_border hover_effect pull-right" alt="Lorem Ipsum" />But due to an increase need to engage and interact with the rapidly globalizing world during the Second Industrial Age, the adoption of worldliness into the Quaker education and culture induced theological and social disputes that potentially had contributing effects in producing the 1827 Separation the Wilburite and Gurneyite schism.
</p> 
                <p>In the wake of these divisions, Quaker education became increasingly influenced by the world outside the Quaker community through the 19th century and early 20th century, while at the same time opposite forces attempted to entrench and insert guarded education into mainstream Quaker culture and education, as observed in the strong Quietist revival, and exemplified in the microcosms of Quaker institutions like the Westtown School, Haverford, Swarthmore, and Bryn Mawr founded during the Second Industrial Age. Examining administrative policies, curricula, and campus life, yields another dimension into how education was influenced by this new world and how it help produce more extensive and diversified networks by impelling new interactions and travel.
