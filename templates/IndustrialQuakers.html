                <p class="feature-paragraph"><img data-img-src="{{STATIC_URL}}images/other_images/tpc.png" class="lazy pull-right" alt="Lorem Ipsum">Thomas Pim Cope, one of the major patriarchs of the Cope family, was born in 1768 to Caleb and Mary Cope in Lancaster, PA. He found “Lancaster too narrow a theatre for his active and ardent spirit” so he moved to Philadelphia at the age of 17, the year 1784, under the condition that he would receive no pecuniary assistance from his father. He worked for his uncle, Thomas Mendenhall, for a year before his father begrudgingly offered him monetary assistance, but Thomas Pim Cope refused to accept it. Thomas Pim Cope would take over his uncle’s company and prove to become successful in the import-export trade, specifically providing tobacco and cotton from the Southern colonies to England. Both he and his line of packet ships traveled extensively, establishing and expanding networks of travel and trade. Thomas Pim Cope forms the perfect example of the industrious iconoclast that emerged in the beginning of the Industrial Age, that represented a revival of Quakers who engaged with the outside world politically and economically

The most prolific example of Quakers advocating public service was the holy experiment that was William Penn’s colony of Pennsylvania.
              </p> <p>
Despite its values during its inception, at the start and throughout most of the 18th century, Quakers were compelled to revoke previous engagements with the outside world because it was thought that “Quaker participation in the government caused intolerable compromises in Quaker belief” (Barbour and Frost).  As a result,  the first half of the 18th century saw friends abdicating their political positions in favor of stringent practices thought to uphold Quaker principles and prevent the threat of religious and communal secularization (Barbour and Frost).

<p>
This political non-engagement was reinforced during the Revolution as Quakers were urged to avoid political participation and revolutionary action. This insistence to adhere to this rigid code not only established the value of political non-engagement, but enforced it. By the end of 1775, 163 Friends had been investigated and 65 were disowned, and from 1776 through 1778 close to 353 more friends were disowned (qtd. in Philadelphia: 300 years, 132). As a result, many Quakers had become more insistent to return to the “original simplicities of the faith, by living more plainly and withdrawing as much as possible from worldly influences” (Philadelphia:300 years, 132). 
Political involvement first re-emerged outside the formal institutions of politics growing within Quaker meetings. Coming out of this inactivity and born in Yearly meetings was the Quaker-led political movement petitioning Congress in 1783 for the abolition of slavery. This would prove to be the starting point for the re-engagement of Quakers, primarily wealthy, in the political sphere during the Industrial Age. These political activists would be engaged with presidential policies, the War of 1812, the National Bank, abolition, the Civil War, Reconstruction, and even presidential assassinations.

To view how the letters are distributed by subject, go to the drop down menu on the side and select which subject you would like to view. The graph will then change to show the letter distribution by subject.  

This visualization is an exploratory tool into the collection, and also attempts to prove a larger trend about what topics, within the Quaker community or outside world, Quakers interacted with during a specific time.  Filtering for subject areas such as political, lifestyle, or travel reveal that  the frequency of letters pertaining to politics, lifestyle, and travel generally increases throughout the Industrial Age. We use the results explored by this visualization to suggest these were topics of increasing interest that the Cope Evans Family engaged with. 

For instance, we can see a spike in the number of letters during periods of crisis in the country or during large political events. These include the Panic of 1837, Lincoln's assassination, and the Civil War.]

Coincidentally, that same year included the first national census as established by the ratification of the United States Constitution. Conceptually, the inception of a census is foundational to this projects argument. Political and economic reasoning notwithstanding, a census is principally based on the movement of people and intended to study and record occupants, out of the knowledge that people must be immigrating or migrating, conceivably at new, more-often frequencies.

                <h1 class="section-title">Cope Political Engagement</h1>

                <p><p> The Cope Evans family papers most prominently features politics in  family members’ review of presidents, the family’s reaction to news of war, roles in the Civil War and Reconstruction, as well as their reactions to Presidential Assassinations.</p>
                <p>Letters in this collection feature Thomas Pim Cope and Francis Reeve Cope issuing indictments of Presidents Jackson and Johnson, respectively.</p>
                <p>In Thomas Pim Cope’s letter to his son Alfred Cope, he chastised Jackson for not rechartering and effectively crushing the National Bank. Pim Cope goes as far to say that Jackson did not “possess the manliness to recharter the bank,” a move that would restore public confidence, enable borrowing, and continue public works. Thomas Pim Cope, the ever-savy businessman was able to forecast the conditions in 1834 that led to the economic Panic of 1837.</p>
                <strong>Thomas Cope to Alfred Cope 1834</strong>
                
                <p>“Our country is indeed in a very portentious condition. Genl Jackson seems to be determined let the consequences be what they may, to crush the Bank of the United States. and such is the foolish nay mad devotion of his immediate partizans, that they are as determined to support him, reckless as to the future. To day we have a message from our Governor, to the Legislature, announcing the failure of his attempts to borrow money. and labouring to throw the blame on the Bank- besides the injustice of this charge, he appears to be but little aware of the effect this will produce on money lenders at home and abroad. Who are [---] thy set, and will be alarmed with fears that the state may not be able to pay the interest of its vast debt- Had he posessed the manliness to recommend the recharter of the Bk public confidence would at once have been restored, and with it the facility of borrowing. He contemplated the stopage of the public works- Who will then be able to calculate the public loss? There can of course be little or no income, and the works themselves must be injured if not ruined.”<a href="#carousel"></p>

                <p>Francis Reeve Cope writes to his daughter, Rachel Reeve Cope Evans, on February 25, 1866, about Andrew Johnson’s February 22nd speech. In Francis’ letter he berates President Johnson’s handling of the Reconstruction “our live President, chosen to air the Union men of the South to our side, seems to be doing his best to destroy the good work the chief war engaged in when called from works to rewards.” Francis believes that Johnson’s half-hearted and backwards form of Reconstruction is sacrificing all that the war promised, making the war and thousands of lives be spent in vain. And then Francis adds insult to injury in recounting Johnson’s presidency, “It is the most humiliating thing this nation has had to endure for many years- worse even than his drunken inauguration speech.”</p>

                    <p>Aug 7, 1862: Charles Drinker requests to join the Navy, would request to join the army, but scared to leave his family alone and feels Navy is safer. 
A letter written during the start of the Civil War is a request by Charles Drinker to Alfred Cope join the Navy. Drinker states that he would enlist in the army but he is the only one to care for his Mother and sisters, and believes that the Navy would be safer. Alfred Cope, as seen in the family dendogram, is the one of the sons of Thomas Pim Cope who took over his father’s mercantile company and presumably would have naval connections. This request is also seemingly unusual because of the Quaker’s adamant stance on pacifism. </p>
<p>
“Alfred Cope Esq </p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I write to you to request you to procure for me a Situation in the Navy as Captains Clerk if Possible I should enlist in the Army but I am the only one at home to care for my Mother & Sisters & they object to my so doing, I may be drafted under the new call & for this reason they will feel satisfied if I can get an opportunity in the Navy as the service is not so hard
very respectfully your friend</p>
Charles M Drinker”

Several letters in the collection show how closely members of this Quaker family followed the Civil War. During the years of the Civil War, a letter was written from Anna Biddie to Rachel Reeve Cope rejoicing about the splendid news of the war, celebrating Philadelphia’s safety, while another letter from Martha Leeds to Ruthanna Cope that details her participation in the Civil War and the conditions of the Hospitals near the Chatanooga battle site. </p>

<p>1862: Splendid War News? Anna Biddie to Rachel Reeve Cope </p>
<p><em>
“He was going off without bidding us good-bye when perhaps we may never see him again. He always was very queer but this beats every thing. Is not the war news splendid? I have not been so glad since the battle of Drainsville, particularly about Howell Cobb the old traitor. There is now not the slightest fear of our having Stonewall Jackson in Philadelphia but I pity the poor citizens of Cincinnati. Cousin Sam Cox was called to a church”</em></p>

<p>From cloud land do I now address thee it has been raining, raining for days – but we cannot wish it otherwise as it will raise the mountain springs which were beginning to fail rapidly it has been rather an anxious care with us to watch the springs for fear they would give out before the cisterns were prepared to save the water and the steam pumps were fixed so that the pure water might be available for the sick in the Hospitals there are but about 500 patients now but it is hoped that the large field Hospital at Chattanooga may soon be moved up here and probably two thirds of the patients that would otherwise die might recover I think there had been but four deaths since the Hospital was established here The air is so fine and the water running” </em></p>

Reconstruction was a time when Quakers eagerly volunteered to aid the paralyzed South. Francis Reeve Cope is one of the major figures in the collection and worked in the Freedmen's Bureau in the Reconstruction movement, as he provided education to freed African-Americans in the South. In one of his letters, Francis describes the small school he is setting up as a “miserable cabin opposite the house where Grant & Lee finished their agreement in writing.” In this miserable cabin “ 300 [students] were taught by 3 young ladies who reside[d] in the school house.]</p><p>
 In the same letter he recounts an anecdote that happened a few days prior where one of the teachers of the school was <em>“visited by a delegation of 20 young men” who informed him that he “ leave by the train [that] day… or they would take his life. But the agent of the Freedmen Bureau & two of the citizens stopped him at the station & brought him back, saying that the solid men of the county, were opposed to the proceeding & wish the school maintained. How far they really wish this or how far they were influenced by the fear of having the military back I cannot say - but I think they were sincere.” </em> This anecdote reveals the tenuous relations still present in the South after the Civil War.  Francis Reeve Cope also told another story of a man who owned more land than any other in the area and and who lost 69 slaves by the war, yet approved of educating negroes, and “had in fact taught his own in a Sunday school before the war & generally agreed with us except on the question of negroes voting.” <em>March 1 1866 - Francis Reeve Cope school Appomattox Court House</em></p>

<p>National events such as presidential assassinations and the response of citizens immediately in the aftermath can be seen in many letters in this collection. One such instance was on April 11,1865, when Clementine Cope began writing a letter to her family  detailing her plans to visit Washington, D.C, when suddenly she stopped writing the letter only to re-continue on April 18th. She wrote, <em>“I have laid aside my letter for two or three days, - for we have all felt so  sad since hearing of the dreadful news that I [could not] feel like writing [about] ordinary things & there seemed little to say on the one great subject- the presidents dreadful death, [which] seemed dreadful enough to strike everyone dumb with horror and astonishment.” </em></p><p>
Clementine would write further on President Lincoln's assassination in a letter to Annette Cope on April 25, 1865. She would write about how she was able to observe the funeral procession and described it as “the most touching and  mournful procession she ever saw,” and that, “It will take a long time to forget the grief & horror of this sad event - but work must go on.”<em>1865 April 25, Baltimore, to Net</em></p>
<p>The collection holds another letter detailing the sadness that accompanied Lincoln’s assassination. This letter written by Susan Reeve to Ruthanna Cope on May 27, 1865 shows the nation’s love for Lincoln, and worry for the transition to Johnson. She wrote, “It seems to me we have, every day, reason to mourn death of our own dear good President seems to me we have, every day, reason to mourn death of our own dear good President - Johnson is so different - & if he should get us into a Mexican war it would be so sad. But we can but hope for the best.” She even goes as far as to disparage  Jefferson Davis, the Confederate President, in her reference to “Poor Jeff,” “a sorry figure in his humiliation he is showing very plainly what a poor miserable specimen of a man he was.- Niether true courage or honor in the slightest appreciative of his great crimes.”<em></p>

<p><strong>1865 May 27, Susan Reeve, to Ruthanna Cope:</strong></p>

<p><em>It seems to me we have, every day, reason to mourn death of our own dear good President - Johnson is so different - & if he should get us into a Mexican war it would be so sad. But we can but hope for the best. Was it not wonderful how suddenly & completely the Rebellion cam to an end. Like the “One hoss slay”- it all broke down at once.- Poor Jeff makes a sorry figure in his humiliation he is showing very plainly what a poor miserable specimen of a man he was.- Niether true courage or honor in the slightest appreciative of his great crimes.</em><p>

<p>And in 1901, close to the outermost bounds of the Industrial Age, the presidential assassination of William McKinley shocked the nation. Two letters in the Cope Evans collection depict the reaction after this event. Anna Cope wrote to Rachel Reeve Cope about the shock of the assassination, and her hopes that Roosevelt will be a fit president in stating, “We have been much greeved at the president's death, it is so shocking to think of his being shot, whilst he was welcoming the people in such a personal way. I hope Roosevelt may prove a good ruler.”</p>
<p>The second letter byAnna Stewardson Browne Cope was sent to her daughter two days after McKinley’s death. In this letter she recounts how the schools had been closed to appropriately mourn the death of the President and expressed sympathy for the Presidents wife, “His wife must be a borne up so well, in her delicate state of health.” </p>
<p>There are many letters and correspondences in the Cope Evans collection that deal with political matters.  These letters, and others like them, provided evidence  in a social trend towards increased engagement of Quakers in the political realm, as well the economic realm.</p>

The prominence in which they gained from economic success established certain groups of Quakers the ability to “shape the civic and institutional life of the city” (Philadelphia: 300 years).

                <h1 class="section-title">Cope Economic Engagement</h1>

                <p>Finance and the national economy are topics featured in select letters throughout the Cope Evans collection.</p>
                <p>The Cope Evans family, like other wealthy Quaker families, ran their business in a manner that was an extension of their religion, and with this ethic members of the Cope family impacted and reacted to the economic climate of the world outside the Quaker community.
</p>
                <p>Thomas Pim Cope, as stated previously, was a main actor and observer of Philadelphia’s economy.  As an owner of his own line of packet ships he conducted foreign shipping with an extensive and lucrative domestic trade, chiefly from the South, and  became a major corner piece of the southern tobacco traffic that was then run through Philadelphia.  His economic influence aided and possibly exceeded his mercantile business, as he played a foundational role in uniting the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays by canal, and in the creation of the Pennsylvania Railroad through raising $300,000 in being the first subscriber and largest shareholder of its stock. 
</p>
                <p>Letters written by Thomas Pim Cope and others received by other Cope family members depict the fluctuating national and economic climate. As noted above, a letter from Thomas Pim Cope to his son in 1834 recognized the conditions of over-speculation, improper handling of loans, and a presidential response that only exacerbated the issue of the Panic of 1837.  A letter written by Thomas Pim Cope’s son, Henry Cope, to his son, Thomas Pim Cope II, provides an account of the difficulties the suspension of banks have imposed on their sound business and the country.</p>
                <h4>Bank difficulties in 1857, cause unknown: Francis Reeve Cope to Thomas Pim Cope 
“I received letters from thee yesterday and today giving some account of the bank difficulties. It is mortifying after the brags we have been making of the soundness of our way of business to find not only that our city is the first to talk, but that the greater part of the country is [while] to stand the shock occasioned by the suspension of our banks…”</h4>
                <p> Quakers’- primarily wealthy Quakers- unparalleled engagement and influence in politics and the economy during the Industrial Age engendered changes that would prompt serious questions in the Quaker community, specifically what values the theology was based on, and how the religion ought to be practiced and lived. It can be argued that these questions, along with revolutionary figures in the religion, provoked a schism and further separations within the Quaker religion during this observed time period.</p>

The anachronistic Pre-Industrial  lifestyle and quietism of traditional Quakers directly opposed the modern lifestyles of Industrial Age liberal Quakers, and in effect may have directly  influenced a series of revolutionary separations. These rigid divisions, first seen in the 1827 Separation of Orthodox and Hicksite, and then again in the splintering of the Orthodox faction into the Wilburite and Gurneyites sects, can be viewed by the motivated desires to define the Quaker religion to a corresponding lifestyle that mirrored an interpretation of how Quakers ought to participate with God, themselves, and the world around them. </p>
