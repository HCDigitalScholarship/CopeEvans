                  <h1>Changing Quaker Lifestyle</h1>
                  <p>Analysis of our visualizations, along with our research into the collection and history suggest that during this time, travel and networks intensified. This intensification correlates to thicker interconnections that can be seen in an increase rate of frequency, an organized or concentrated network system, and an increased influence on subjects and lifestyles. </p>
                  <p>While viewing the intensification of networks, we recognized that networks- specifically those associated with philanthropy- became diversified, but we were unable to prove with statistical analysis or through the aid of exploratory visualizations. Until further scholarship is developed, for the intents of this project we will merely glimpse at the history of Quaker philanthropy, and how it provides an example of how Quaker networks diversified during the Industrial Age.</p>
                  <p>This section will explore the indivisible relationship among education, travel, and the changes in these networks.  Both how education has impelled travel and the intensification of these networks, and how the changes in Quaker education can be used as a reflection of the changed relationships and newly adopted values unique to the Industrial Age. </p>

Clementine spent the her 64 years unmarried and independent, traveling all over the Europe. Between 1878 and 1880, Clementine and her two sisters, Caroline and Annette, went on a European tour that featured stops in Italy and the Swiss Alps.

By selecting a range of years on the timeline below, and advancing that range into the mid to later years of the 19th century, there is a noticeable increase in frequency and distance in the family’s movement. </p>
                <p>Our visualizations and statistical analysis of the Cope Evans collection clearly shows that there was an increase in the exchange of letters. The difficulty in proving our point that networks were intensified, is that this data and analysis are seemingly dependent on how the letters were collected, or how the letters were saved and passed down within the family, survived history, or even how they were donated to Haverford, rather than there serving as proof of a larger trend of increased communication.</p>

                <h1 class="section-title">Diversification of Networks: Philanthropy</h1>

                <p>Eighteenth century Quaker philanthropy, as argued by Thomas Mann, was grounded in the desire to be disentangled from all obstacles to holiness (Hamm 1988, 22, 31). But the Quakers that did commit to works of philanthropy established conventions that would persist through the latter parts of the Industrial Age, well past their efficacy and urgency. It was not until the latter part of the Industrial Age that changes in values, relationships, and networks caused Quakers to diversify their public works and the audience they reached.</p>
                <p>During their early history, as far back as 1695, Quakers established programs and networks that provided aid to women, children, and prisoners. This system of philanthropy was defined by Quakers giving the poor and needy useful employment in exchange for education. Common roles in this system were that inmates would work on the farm while women and girls would cook (Oxford Encyclopedia).</p>
                <p>Quaker conservatism, reinforced by Quietist forces forged in opposition to globalizing pressures and internal division, sustained conventional forms of Quaker-led philanthropy prioritizing needs of their traditional recipients despite the evolving demographic. Their alienation from and bias against the modern norms that  manifested in Philadelphia’s changing moral standards, populace, and culture caused Quakers to engage in outmoded works imposing prohibitive measures against urban behavior and reinforced established networks of philanthropy for women and children, while neglecting a new urban population dealing with the social troubles inseparable in the American Industrial Age (Benjamin).</p>

                  <div class="blockquote">Quaker scholar Thomas Hamm writes that Wilbur ‘feared that contact with the world even with the most benevolent and human intentions, would distract friends from the great struggle of the soul toward holiness’ (1988, 28)</div>
                  	<p>Evangelical Friends were committed to social change and missions, linking holiness to social transformation; however, for some Holiness Friends the expectation of the imminent Second Coming meant evangelism rather than social reform was primary (Hamm 1988, 119) and (Oxford Encyclopedia of Quaker Studies).</p>
                  	<p>The Religious Society of Friends took a global presence through their evangelical outreach by Quaker missionaries in the 18th and 19th century. Missions would inevitably change to take on the meaning of social activism and reform. Early missionaries preached along the Western Atlantic and Continental Europe, Western Asia, British West Indies or American mainland (Oxford Encyclopedia). The Friends foreign missionary enterprise peaked  between 1890 and 1930, establishing FEMA networks and serving as humanitarians to new audiences all over the globe.</p>
                	<p>A few examples of this same of diversification happening among Quakers is briefly reflected in the Cope-Evans Collection and the lives of its members. Alfred Cope, Francis Pim Cope, Thomas Pim Cope, Charles Evans, Robert Evans, and William Evans were all members of the Prison Society that were devoted to improve public prison conditions. But in several letters a new model of philanthropy is featured. In one such letter in 1851, Jonathan Pim Cope wrote to Thomas Pim Cope on the conditions of his donation of fifty pounds to the “Belfast Ladies Relief Association for Connaught,” which appears to aid those troubled by the Irish Famine, and even connects the Irish troubles to how it may affect Irish manufacturing and potentially the family business. </p>
                	<p>“I have to thank thee for again making me the medium of thy bounty to the "Belfast Ladies "Relief Association for Connaught". I sent the Fifty Pounds on receipt to my friend Mary Murphy, and have the enclosed acknowledgment from her son. In a few days I hope to receive from her some particulars of the present condition of the Association, and some statistics of the trade in sewed muslin, which is now a very important branch of Irish manufacture, and to which their labor largely contributed.” Jonathan Pim Cope to Thomas Pim Cope 1851</p>
                    <p>Our final  example is of Clementine Cope’s significant donation of 15,000 dollars upon her death for the promotion of education among Russian immigrants (Benjamin 116). </p>

This value rejected worldly influence and prevented adapting cultural styles, seeing them as unnecessary aberrations, while relying on curricula in favor of traditional teachings that sheltered children from outside influences, and ultimately engendered a static and cloistered lifestyle throughout adulthood.</p>
                <!-- <p>Quaker schools were first aimed to create a sheltered environment where the child would be away from “evil influences.”  As a result, the dress and curriculum of these schools reflected values and appearances of an approved lifestyle within the isolated Quaker community (Oxford Encyclopedia).

The Orthodox required Monthly Meetings to have schools with a guarded education This was a primary obligation because it was to assure the youth would be brought up in the faith properly, meaning that they wouldn’t be interfered with by outside, corrupting influences, and so the faith could survive in its traditional form and members (Benjamin).</p>

                <h1 class="section-title">A Changing Education </h1>

                <p class="feature-paragraph"><img data-img-src="{{STATIC_URL}}images/other_images/hsc1167_01.jpg" class="lazy pull-right" alt="Lorem Ipsum"><p> In the wake of these divisions, Quaker education became increasingly influenced by the world outside the Quaker community through the 19th century and early 20th century, while at the same time opposite forces attempted to entrench and insert guarded education into mainstream Quaker culture and education, as observed in the strong Quietist revival, and exemplified in the microcosms of Quaker institutions like the Westtown School founded in 1799, Haverford College founded in 1883, Swarthmore College founded in 1864, and Bryn Mawr College founded in885. Examining administrative policies, curricula, and campus life, yields another dimension into how education was influenced by this new world and how it help produce more extensive and diversified networks by impelling new interactions and travel.
</p>
                <p>But during this pedlogical movement towards a progressive education, there was an equal and reactionary response to the threats and potentially irreversible effects on Quaker education that these newly formed, intensified, and diversified networks promised. As a result, Quaker-led institutions and Yearly meetings ordered a reversion back to  manners primarily and traditional disciplines taught and practiced before the Industrial Age. 
</p>

                  <p> Manners of simplicity were reinforced by these institutions in an attempt at entrenching guarded education firmly and prolifically in the future lifestyle of Quaker children, adults, and communities. Westtown was know for how “diligently it worked against the forces of contemporary culture (Benjamin 36).” Most notably were the exclusion of poetry, drama, and prose fiction in the reading program. Haverford College restricted the acquisition of fiction till 1900, and dramatic productions were not allowed till 1910.
</p>
                  <p>The Westtown administration and authorities sent children home if clothing did not comply with Quaker plainness of style, and “devised countless ways to get students to use ‘thee’ instead of you. This enforcement of language, in their restricted reading program and the emphasis on plain language,  led us to believe that the influence of outside culture and networks was observed in speech patterns. As a result, we analyzed the text of the transcribed letters , as seen below, specifically targeting plain language such as “thy” and “thee” to see if there there was a generational movement away from plain language, that supports the Westtown’s belief of cultural assimilation of language and lends credibility to our claim of the outside world’s increasing influence on more intensely engaged Quakers.</p>
                  <h3>Textual Analysis</h3>
                  <p><img data-img-src="{{STATIC_URL}}images/other_images/UseOfThyGraph.png" class="lazy hover_effect pull-center" alt="Lorem Ipsum">These two graphs chart the frequency during specific decades that the plain language words “thee” and “thy” were used within the transcribed Cope Evans letters. It is interesting to note the decreasing frequency of  “thy” during times when modern education and culture diminished its use, while the peaks can be explained by movements towards re-establishing plain language as seen in the Westtown School administrative policy and sentiments expressed in the letter from Mary Drinker to Eleanor Cope.
 </p>
                    <p><img src="{{STATIC_URL}}images/other_images/useOfThee.png " class=" hover_effect pull-center" >
                  <p>The impositions and additions on these institutions curricula accurately portrays the contrasting movements and revisions of an increasingly progressive education battling the forces of administrators wishing to retain the tradition of Quaker guarded education.</p>
               <p>And At the end of the century, the teaching of religion became a controversial topic in Quaker institutions. New techniques, popular among scholars and professors at Haverford, was a “more sophisticated” interpretation and analysis of the Old and New Testaments. Francis Reece Cope in the following letter to Henry Cope describes this change in how schools taught the Bible</p>
              <st>October 25, 1837 Francis R. Cope to Henry Cope</st>
<p>“The Council have introduced a new plan of studying Scripture on 1st day. The whole school is divided into two classes who recite to D. B. Smith who then delivers a lecture on Ethics—These lectures are compiled from books which D. B. Smith is writing and which when finished will form the course of study in Moral Philosophy for the School. I have had a cold in my head ever since I came to the School but it has not been bad at any time. But I shall not have time to write any more at present as I must study my lesson.”</p> 
<p>In viewing the adoption of a progressive and culturally modern education, it is interesting to see how collegiate architecture during this time reflects this trend. During the 19th Century, Walter Cope and Tom Stewardson, and their architectural firm Cope and Stewardson, took over as the most sought after Quaker architects.In their designs of Bryn Mawr College and the University of Pennsylvania dorms, Walter Cope and Tom Stewardson featured Gothic and Jacobean aesthetics and “managed to temper simplicity with ornamental styles (Benjamin).”These Gothic lines, lancet windows, spires, and other motifs were echoed an influence of worldly fashion on a historically plain aesthetic typical of Quakers and their meeting houses. </p>
<img src="{{STATIC_URL}}images/other_images/magill.jpg" class=" hover_effect pull-left" style="width:150px; margin-right:0px;" alt="Magill Library"><img src="{{STATIC_URL}}images/other_images/barclay.jpg" class=" hover_effect pull-center" alt="Barclay"><img src="{{STATIC_URL}}images/other_images/taylor hall.jpg" class=" hover_effect pull-right" style="margin-left:0px;width:150px;" alt="Taylor Hall">
<p>The institutions stances on education were not only exhibited in their enforcement of traditional Quaker practices, curriculum, architecture but also in the social life of students.  Swarthmore College ignored the Quaker testimonies of equality, community, and pacifism, as claimed by Haverford College administrators, by introducing fraternities in 1888. Haverford, adamantly establishing itself as a school more entrenched in guarded education, believed that fraternities destroyed the college’s community life and Quaker spirit (Benjamin). </p>
                <p>The forms of modern education that were integrated into these institutions  in the early and middle part of 19th century, introduced the Quaker youth to secular influences would prove to later impact the values, practices, and lifestyles of Quakers, and help try to establish modern practices of education.  As this education informed educators and students of the mid to latter 19th century, letter to a greater emphasis on the demolition of rule-bound form and more modern forms of education, as demonstrated in this quote from Philadelphia Quakers in the Industrial age, “The demolition of the rule-bound forms which marked the faith at the time of the Civil War can be attributed to friends schooled in the early years of these Quaker institutions (Benjamin).”</p>
                <p> In 1910 Isaac Sharpless, the President of Haverford College, described and supported the movement of students’,of  the latter part of the 19th century,  desire for a more progressive education,  “It is more in touch with the world around, it is more open to new ideas, it is less inclined to accept as conclusive argument for itself that Friends in the past followed certain customs. It is probably no less loyal to fundamental Quakerism; and it is much more hopeful that this will become, not the possession of a slowly dying though very respectable remnant, but a growing and vigorous organism adapting itself to the problems of its environment, and winning strength and confidence by its real efficiency.”
