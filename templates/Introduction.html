This project ought to serve as an invitation into more possibilities, questions, and scholarly research.  A possible question and caveat of this project is surrounded around how the Cope Evans family and their values or practices may differ from Quakers of their time due to their affluence.</p>

Through these letters and the lives of the writers/recipients we are able to provide insight into how the Industrial Age produced Quakers that engaged with the outside world, through our analysis of their letters, movement and networks. In our research and analysis, we look at how the changing times, the changing Philadelphia city, and changing lifestyle impacted and were impacted by these networks and movement.<a href="#carousel"></a></p>

</p>
<p>
 
The collection consists of letters (with accompanying poetry, acrostics, drawings, clippings, etc.); along with marriage certificates, photographs, a friendship book, estate related papers, and account books. The bulk of the collection consists of ca. 2,600 letters of the closely related Quaker families of Cope and Evans of Germantown (Philadelphia, Pa.); others represented include the Brown, Drinker and Haines families. Letters are predominantly to and from relatives: the vast majority are between immediate family members (parents and children, husbands and wives, brothers, sisters).
 </p> <p>
They discuss family, friends and home life, and reflect the social environment of their respective communities. Other topics to be found within the letters include Philadelphia history, Haverford history, travels in Europe, education, illness and death, and discussions of national events such as the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the assassinations of Presidents Lincoln and McKinley. They are a rich source of information on a large number of topics.</p>

Letters of Mary Cope (1766-1825) to her children at school are full of affection and advice, both practical and spiritual. Thomas Pim Cope's letters include those to his son Henry at Westtown, as well as letters reflecting on his business interests - including a copy of an 1805 letter to his then partner, J. Thomas, requesting they end their business association because of Thomas's sloppy book-keeping habits.
The letters of Anna S. Cope (1822-1916) and Francis R. Cope (1821-1909) discuss home life and children, family and friends activities; many of Anna S. Cope's letters were written from family vacation spots in New England, where she often went to escape the hot summer months in Philadelphia. Letters of Francis R. Cope include letters written while in Virginia on Freedmen's Relief Association business after the Civil War (1866) as well as letters related to the sale of Pa. Freedmen's Assoc. property in Washington, D.C.</p>
                    <p>
The letters of sisters Clementine, Caroline and Annette Cope include many travel letters from Europe. Clementine Cope's letters also include those written while teaching at a Freedmen's Association School in Baltimore in 1865.
There are a number of letters written by children; of particular interest are those written by brothers Henry, Francis and William D. Cope while at Westtown Boarding School in the early 1800s and letters of brothers Francis R. Cope (1821-1909) and Thomas P. Cope (1823-1900) while at Haverford College in the 1830s.</p>
