                  <h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p>What is this project: The focus of our project are the changing networks and relationships during the Industrial Age for Quakers, as seen through the exchange of letters between the Cope Evans family, a prominent Philadelphia-area Quaker family, during 1790 to 1910.</p>
<p>How did networks change for Quakers from 1790 to 1910: They extended, accelerated, intensified, and diversified. But as stated before, we will narrow our view to intensifying networks. In claiming that the intensity of connections increased we suggest that connections became more interconnected and thicker, meaning that connections were more organized and had a greater influence on this group.
</p>
<p>Networks and relationships changed because of a demand specific to the time and group to engage with the outside world (relationship of Quakers to the Outside world) as seen through political, economic, and social motives and demonstrated in travel the changing times in areas of changing technology and a changing Philadelphia landscapes (relationship of Quakers to the time)</p>
    <p>As a result,changing networks and relationships influenced:</p>
                <p>Travel, Education, Fashion, Philanthropy</p>
                  <!-- to add scrolling effects to links linking to same page section, add .link-scroll class -->

There are many questions this project has produced and will produce, and it was a relentless struggle to restrain ourselves. This project ought to serve as an invitation into more possibilities, questions, and scholarly research.  A possible question and caveat of this project is surrounded around how the Cope Evans family and their values or practices may differ from Quakers of their time due to their affluence.</p>

Beginning in circa 1790 to span the Second Industrial Age, Quakerism transformed from a theologically bordered religion and a cloistered community with few far reaching movements to incorporate parts of an outside world that Quakers previously fought against. The resulting changes in relationships, values, and networks would eventually diffuse into, although with much resistance, many aspects of the Quaker lifestyle like education, travel, fashion, and philanthropy.
                    <p>Our argument, analysis, and re-narration of this Quaker history through the Cope-Evans family and Quakers as a whole, contribute insight into the mechanisms and products of this reaction by a specific group to this specific time.</p><a href="#carousel"></a></p>

                      <p>The Cope Evans project began with careful readings of letters written and received by Cope Evans family members. From this document-based research we observed and recorded evidence of common themes, such as : religion/spirituality, education, literature and poetry, weather and nature, medicine and health, women, politics, traveling, and family. Upon further research and placing the documents in a large historical of the time period and of Quakers during that time period, we were able to narrow our view to education and travel.</p>

                      <p>Initially, we felt like we needed to separate the subjects to adequately derive a satisfactory and specific argument about either, but after reading secondary sources and by placing the letters in position generationally, we were inevitably compelled to analyze the collection differently, which ultimately formed the early foundations of an argument that established an indivisible relationship between education and travel. A relationship that showed that  a more modern education was both a byproduct of globalizing forces and a catalyst for travel and globalization.</p>

                      <p>After research in seemingly tangential areas a period-specific narrative started to become articulated. This longer historical narrative formed in reading about internal division of the 1827 separation and the conditions for the schism, the new dress and  lifestyle Thomas Pim Cope and other Quakers of the early 1800’s possessed, the formation and administrative policies of Quaker-based institutions, the infamous theological debate between Wilburites and Gurneyites, forms of Quaker philanthropy near and far, a resurgence in Quietest Movements during the 1860’s, as well as larger areas of study, like the Industrial Revolution, 19th and early 20th century Philadelphia- a city that changed demographically and infrastructurally, and even Victorian Gothic Architecture.</p>
