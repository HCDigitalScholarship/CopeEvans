    <h3>What is The Cope Evans Project?</h3>
</body>
  <p>  The Cope Evans Project is a Digital Humanities project sponsored by Haverford Libaries through the Special Collections and Digital Scholarship Departments. This academic project is based on a collection of family papers, The Cope Evans Papers, that was generously donated to the school's Special Collections. </p>
    <p>Rather than writing an academic paper or digitizing more material,we set out to make a virtual exhibit of our research, data visualizations, and analyses. Throughout these pages you will see images of the collection's materials, most notably the letterheads that are featured as some of the backgrounds. Other imporatant attributes of this project are data visualizations that were developed from data collected within the digitized collection. 
     </p>   <p>
These visualizations are both exploratory and argumentative, so please feel free to click on the visualizations and play around!  While you are navigating through the website, you will notice that most names are underlined. If you click on one of these names, a drop down menu will appear underneath their name with a list of visualizations that are connected to that person. To select a visualization, simply click on the name within the menu. This functionality carries on even within visualizations in order to make navigation between visualizations easier. Our hope is that while exploring the site, you will begin to create your own narrative about the Cope and Evans family, as you begin to recognize all the members of the Cope Evans family, and see just how intertwined each actor is to the larger story.</p>
